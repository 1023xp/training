- add better filehandling to jutil
	- replace 'is_in_current_dir' in TestRunner

- add error reporting (use jutils::warn?)

- store failed file, line and string and allow access afterwards (by
  test number).

- add more test language support (e.g. skipped tests)

- TestRunner needs an abstract base which doesn't take an ostream&
	- allow for a GUI, for example
	- ConsoleTestRunner should inherit
	- or maybe not...just different reporting methods


DONE - pull out the Pcre + jutil code into library routines
	- aha...add the test runner to the library...
	- need to ship it for "make test"

DONE - check plan
