This directory contains the original userspace tool (exmap.pl) and
associated code and tests. As of exmap version 0.8, the C++ version is
the intended userspace tool (it is faster and uses less memory).

Please feel free to make use of this, older perl version but be warned
that I'd rather add any missing features to the C++ version than keep
this perl version up to date.
