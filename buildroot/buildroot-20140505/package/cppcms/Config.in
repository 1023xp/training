	  CppCMS is a Free High Performance Web Development Framework
	  (not a CMS) aimed for Rapid Web Application Development. It
	  differs from most of other web development frameworks like:
	  Python Django or Java Servlets on  the following aspects:

	   - It is designed and tuned to handle extremely high loads.
	   - It uses modern C++ as primary development language in
	     order to achieve the above goal.
	   - It is aimed on development of both Web Sites and Web
	     Services.
