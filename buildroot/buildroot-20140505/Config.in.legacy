#
# Config.in.legacy - support for backward compatibility
#
# When an existing Config.in symbol is removed, it should be added again in
# this file, and take appropriate action to approximate backward compatibility.
# This will make the transition for the user more convenient.
#
# When adding legacy symbols to this file, add them to the front. The oldest
# symbols will be removed again after about two years.
#
# The symbol should be copied as-is from the place where it was previously
# defined, but the help text should be removed or replaced with something that
# explains how to fix it.
#
# For bool options, the old symbol should select BR2_LEGACY, so that the user
# is informed at build-time about selected legacy options.
# If there is an equivalent (set of) new symbols, these should be select'ed by
# the old symbol for backwards compatibility.
#
# For string options, it is not possible to directly select another symbol. In
# this case, a hidden wrap bool option has to be added, that defaults to y if
# the old string is not set at its default value. The wrap symbol should select
# BR2_LEGACY.
# If the original symbol has been renamed, the new symbol should use the value
# of the old symbol as default. This requires a change outside of
# Config.in.legacy, and this should be clearly marked as such below, so that
# removal of legacy options also include the removal of these external
# references.
#
# [Example: renaming a string option from FOO to BAR]
# original symbol:
#     config BR2_FOO_STRING
#             string "Some foo string"
#
# becomes:
#     config BR2_BAR_STRING
#             string "Some bar string"
#             default BR2_FOO_STRING if BR2_FOO_STRING != ""  # legacy
#
# and in Config.in.legacy:
#     config BR2_FOO_STRING
#             string "The foo string has been renamed"
#             help
#               <suitable help text>
#
#     config BR2_FOO_STRING_WRAP
#             bool
#             default y if BR2_FOO_STRING != ""
#             select BR2_LEGACY
#
#     # Note: BR2_FOO_STRING is still referenced from package/foo/Config.in
#
# [End of example]
