aclocal
#Because `configure.in' contains macro invocations which are not known to autoconf itself--AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE being a case in point, it is necessary to collect all of the macro definitions for autoconf to use when generating `configure'.

If you were to examine the contents of `aclocal.m4', you would find the definition of the AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE macro contained within.
