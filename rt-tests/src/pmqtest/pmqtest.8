.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
The program \fBpmqtest\fR starts pairs of threads that are synchronized via mq_send/mw_receive() and measures the latency between sending and receiving the message.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-affinity[=PROC]
Run on procesor number PROC. If PROC is not specified, run on current processor.
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-breaktrace=USEC
Send break trace command when latency > USEC. This is a debugging option to control the latency tracer in the realtime preemption patch.
It is useful to track down unexpected large latencies of a system.
.TP
.B \-d, \-\-distance=DIST
Set the distance of thread intervals in microseconds (default is 500 us). When pmqtest is called with the -t option and more than one thread is created, then this distance value is added to the interval of the threads: Interval(thread N) = Interval(thread N-1) + DIST
.TP
.B \-f, \-\-forcetimeout=TO
Set an artificial delay of the send function to force timeout of the receiver, requires the -T option
.TP
.B \-i, \-\-interval=INTV
Set the base interval of the thread(s) in microseconds (default is 1000 us). This sets the interval of the first thread. See also -d.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-loops=LOOPS
Set the number of loops. The default is 0 (endless). This option is useful for automated tests with a given number of test cycles. pmqtest is stopped once the number of timer intervals has been reached.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-prio=PRIO
Set the priority of the process.
.TP
.B \-S, \-\-smp
Test mode for symmetric multi-processing, implies -a and -t and uses the same priority on all threads.
.TP
.B \-t, \-\-threads[=NUM]
Set the number of test threads (default is 1, if this option is not given). If NUM is specified, create NUM test threads. If NUM is not specifed, NUM is set to the number of available CPUs.
.TP
.B \-T, \-\-timeout=TO
Use mq_timedreceive() instead of mq_receive() and specify timeout TO in seconds.

The following example was running on an 8-way processor:
