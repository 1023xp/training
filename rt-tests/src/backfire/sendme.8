\fBsendme\fR \- Send a signal from driver to user and measure time intervals
.SH "SYNTAX"

sendme [-a|-a PROC] [-b USEC] [-l loops] [-p PRIO]

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.LP
The program \fBsendme\fR uses the \fBbackfire\fR driver to send a signal from driver to user. It then reads the timestamp from the driver and calculates the time intervals to call the driver and to receive the signal from the driver.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.TP
.B \-a, \-\-affinity[=PROC]
Run on procesor number PROC. If PROC is not specified, run on current processor.
.TP
.B \-b, \-\-breaktrace=USEC
Send break trace command when latency > USEC. This is a debugging option to control the latency tracer in the realtime preemption patch.
It is useful to track down unexpected large latencies on a system.
.TP
.B \-l, \-\-loops=LOOPS
Set the number of loops. The default is 0 (endless). This option is useful for automated tests with a given number of test cycles. Sendme is stopped once the number of timer intervals has been reached.
.TP
.B \-p, \-\-prio=PRIO
Set the priority of the process.
